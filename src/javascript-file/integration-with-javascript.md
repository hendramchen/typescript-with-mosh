# Integration with JavaScript

## Summary

- To include JavaScript code in a TypeScript project, we need to enable the allowJs setting in tsconfig.
- JavaScript code included in TypeScript projects is not type-checked by default.
- We can enable type checking by enabling the checkJs setting in tsconfig.
- We can optionally turn off compiler errors on a file-by-file basis by applying // @ts-nocheck once on top of JavaScript files.
- When migrating a large JavaScript project to TypeScript, we might face numerous errors. In such cases, it’s easier to disable checkJs and apply // @ts-check (the opposite of @ts-nocheck) on individual files to migrate them one by one.
- We have two ways to describe type information for JavaScript code: using JSDoc and declaration (type definition files).
- Type definition files are similar to header files in C. They describe the features of a module.
- We don’t need to create type definition files for third-party JavaScript libraries. We can use type definition files from the Definitely Typed GitHub repository (@types/<package>).
- Newer JavaScript libraries come with type definition files. So there’s no need to install type definition files separately.
